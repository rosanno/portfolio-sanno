          I&apos;m Rosanno Macabuhay, a web developer from
          the Philippines. Although I am just starting my
          career, I have a deep passion for creating
          purposeful and intuitive web interfaces. My main
          goal is to bridge the divide between people and
          technology, transforming intricate challenges into
          meaningful and seamless digital experiences.
